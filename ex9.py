# Here's some new strange stuff. Remember type it exactly.

# creating a variable with a string
days = "\nMon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun\n" 
# this string has a few "new line" symbols
months = "\nJan\nFebr\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug" 

# printing 1 string and than another one - the variable
print("Here are the days: ", days) 
print("Here are the months: ", months)

# printing the text as it looks like in a code - no need to use "new line" symbols here
print("""
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
